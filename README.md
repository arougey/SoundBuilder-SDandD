This is Soundbuilder, a sound app developed using Agile principles during RPI's Software Design and Documentation class in Fall 2025. Soundbuilder allows users to mix and play their own
custom sounds, creating a pleasing soundscape and listening experience for users to work, sleep, and relax to. It is built using Flutter, which enables compatibility across different 
devices.
